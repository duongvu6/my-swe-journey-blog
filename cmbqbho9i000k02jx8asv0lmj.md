This is a post to introduce the writer to all the readers. My name is Duong Vu, and currently I am a junior student. My major is Computer Science with Data Science orientation so I have some mixed knowledge of Software Engineering field and Data Science field but I am more interested in Software Engineering field. I am currently learning design patterns and system design. I want to use this platform as a way I can relearn what I am studying to understand topic clearer by explaining to others, a way to practicing English. I am also having a plan to record videos and post on Youtube.

In this platform, maybe there are English posts or Vietnamese posts and there is no pattern about which type of post I use English or Vietnamese, it just about if I feel I should write in English or Vietnamese

I hope everyone will enjoy reading my posts and hoping that you will learn something here and my blog will help you to some extent
